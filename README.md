# Final-Boss-Counter
Point and stats counter for our game Final Boss

In Final Boss Players face Enemies.

Both Players and Enemies have Attack and Health stats that need to be kept track of.

Enemies first hit Players, Enemy attack against Player health. If layer health <= Enemy attack, they die.

Then Players counterattack following the same rules, Enemy's health against Player attack.

The app indicates whether the player is winning or losing. If the player has health = 0 and is attacked by Enemy attack = 0, they also die.

Players also need to keep track of Victory Coins and Power Gems, which are two elements of the game.
